# Webflow Webhooks & Triggers: Automating Your Workflows Like a Pro

Webflow's webhooks and triggers are your secret weapons for automating tasks and notifications, making your online life easier and more efficient. Here's a quick breakdown with clean code examples:

**1. What are Webhooks?**

Imagine a bell ringing every time something specific happens on your Webflow site. That's a webhook in action! It sends a real-time notification to another service (like Zapier or Airtable) whenever a trigger event occurs (like form submission or page visit).

**2. Trigger Events: Your Automation Triggers**

Think of these as the bells that set off your automation flow. Popular trigger events include:

  - **Form Submissions:** Send emails, update databases, or trigger custom actions.
  - **Page Visits:** Personalize content, track user behavior, or send notifications.
  - **User Actions:** Automate tasks based on button clicks, scroll depth, or other interactions.
  - **Collection Updates:** React to changes in your website's data (e.g., new blog post published).

**3. Popular Webhook Integrations:**

Connect your Webflow site to a world of possibilities with these powerful tools:

  - **Zapier:** The Swiss Army knife of automation, connecting your site to thousands of other services.
  - **Integromat:** Build complex workflows with advanced features and flexibility.
  - **Airtable:** Automate data management by sending website data to your Airtable base.

**4. Clean Code Examples:**

Example 1: Sending an email on form submission with Zapier:

  - No coding required! Use Webflow's built-in Zapier integration to create a Zap that automatically sends an email whenever your form is submitted.

**Example 2:** Tracking page visits with Airtable:
```
HTML
<wf-if for="page.visited">
  <wf-api-request
    url="https://api.airtable.com/v0/yourBaseId/yourTableName"
    method="POST"
    data="{
      "Page": "{{ page.title }}",
      "URL": "{{ page.url }}"
    }"
  ></wf-api-request>
</wf-if>

```
